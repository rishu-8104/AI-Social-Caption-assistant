# 📱 AI-Powered Social Media Image Captioning App  

## 📌 Overview  
The **AI-Powered Social Media Image Captioning App** is a smart tool designed to generate engaging and platform-optimized captions for images. It provides a **real-time preview** of how the post will appear on different social media platforms, including **Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter (X)**. Users can upload an image, click **"Generate Caption"**, and instantly see a simulated UI of their post with a suggested caption.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **AI-Generated Captions** – Automatically creates platform-specific captions (witty, professional, trendy, etc.)

✅ **Engagement Icons & Formatting** – Includes likes, comments, profile icons, and buttons for a realistic preview
